# Contributing Guidelines

🎉 **First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!** 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## 📜 Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/krishguptadev/open-source-best-practices/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 🤔 How can I contribute?

### 💣 Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report 📝 reproduce the behavior 💻 and find related reports 🔎

Since the new GitHub Issue forms we only suggest you to include most information possible. But you can also **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/krishguptadev/open-source-best-practices/issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### 🛠 Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion 📝 and find related suggestions. 🔎

## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages 📝

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or less_.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at _72 characters_.
- Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, _vs_, and _how_.
- Reference [issues](https://github.com/krishguptadev/open-source-best-practices/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/krishguptadev/open-source-best-practices/pulls) liberally after the first line.
- Follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines
