# Project maintainer checklist
- [ ] ReadMe
  * This is the most important file in your project! It is the first file
  everyone will see because it is previewed on your repo landing
  page. Make sure you include: pre-requisites, quickstart,
  screenshots

- [ ] License
  * If you do not have a license your project is NOT Open Source.
There are many great licenses to pick from; two popular licenses
are MIT and GPLv3

- [ ] Desription, Url, Topis
  * The repo has settings for description, url and topics. Make sure to
use these fields and keep them concise and relevant.


- [ ] Code Of Conduct
  * This is very often overlooked, but just like licenses it is a very
important file and without it, could be preventing people from
contributing to your project. There are templates for these, you do
NOT need to write one of scratch.


- [ ] Issues
  * Even if you are the only person working on the project at the
moment, use the issues section. This will help you organise the
project and allow community members to understand what is
happening on the project.

- [ ] Commits
   * Commits meesages are required. Be descriptive but concise to
add value. Therefore are some great automations that can be
done with GitHub Actions using these commit messages; for
example auto generate changelog.

- [ ] RELEASES, TAGS
   * It is important to create read only check points for your project,
aka release / tag. These can also include features and bugs fixes
that are contained in that release.
