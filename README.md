# Project maintainer checklist
- [ ] ReadMe
  * This is the most important file in your project! It is the first file
  everyone will see because it is previewed on your repo landing
  page. Make sure you include: pre-requisites, quickstart,
  screenshots


- [ ] License
  * If you do not have a license your project is NOT Open Source.
There are many great licenses to pick from; two popular licenses
are MIT and GPLv3

- [ ] Desription, Url, Topis
  * The repo has settings for description, url and topics. Make sure to
use these fields and keep them concise and relevant.


- [ ] Code Of Conduct
  * This is very often overlooked, but just like licenses it is a very
important file and without it, could be preventing people from
contributing to your project. There are templates for these, you do
NOT need to write one of scratch.
